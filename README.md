# Leitstand in a Nutshell

Leitstand aims to create a disaggregated management system for the  disaggregated access network by means of providing the foundation to model the resources forming the network and an environment to implement management applications supplying the actual network management functions.

Leitstand relies on _service-oriented architecture_ , 
loose coupling through REST APIs and 
service encapsulation in docker containers in order to support a distributed deployment.
The Leitstand architecture is also influenced by Eric Evans domain-driven design, in the sense of putting the focus on the network management domain and leveraging open-source software for general management aspects like log management, telemetry streaming, or time series visualization.

Leitstand can be extended by adding new services and customized by replacing default implementations.
